# Scheme

Scheme is a Python-based interpretor for a subset of the Scheme language. The subset of the language used in this project is 
described in the [Functional Programming](http://composingprograms.com/pages/32-functional-programming.html) section of 
Composing Programs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the ```Scheme``` archive by downloading [```Scheme-master.zip```](https://github.com/tchitete1/Scheme/archive/master.zip)
2. Open a new terminal window in the directory where the archive was downloaded
3. Unzip the archive using the following command to obtain the ```Scheme-master``` directory:
```
unzip Scheme-master.zip
```
4. Change into the ```Scheme-master``` directory by executing the following command:
```
cd Scheme-master
```

### Execution

* To execute ```Scheme```, execute the following:
```
python3 scheme.py
```

Upon executing the above, a ```scm>``` prompt will be displayed on the terminal. From there, you can execute typical Scheme commands. 
To stop execution, press ```ctrl```+```D```.
